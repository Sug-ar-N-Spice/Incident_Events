    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "My final results showcase two models: one utilizing RandomizedSearch for hyperparameter tuning and the other relying on manually set parameters. Despite the difference in approach, both models produced nearly identical performance, with the key metric being a **balanced accuracy score of 73%**. The slight **2% overfit** observed between training and testing scores demonstrates that the model generalizes well, though there is still some room for optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "1. **Refining the Target Variable**:  \n",
    "   Currently, the model predicts whether an incident ticket is resolved in 2 days or less. However, there are alternative target columns that could provide further insights, such as:\n",
    "   - Binary column for incidents resolved in 1 day or less\n",
    "   - Binary column for incidents resolved in 3 days or less\n",
    "   - Binary column for incidents resolved in 4 days or less\n",
    "\n",
    "   Testing these alternate targets could yield more nuanced models that address a broader range of scenarios within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exploring Neural Networks**:  \n",
    "   Neural networks, with their ability to capture complex relationships within the data, could potentially provide a significant boost in prediction accuracy. I plan to explore this avenue to further improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project has provided valuable hands-on experience with machine learning techniques, and I am excited to continue refining and expanding these models to further enhance their effectiveness.\n"
